## TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement
network protocols. It consists of four layers:

1. **Application Layer**: This layer includes protocols that provide network
   services to applications. Examples include HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.
2. **Transport Layer**: This layer is responsible for end-to-end communication
   between devices. It includes protocols like TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
   and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
3. **Internet Layer**: This layer handles the routing of data packets across
   networks. The main protocol at this layer is IP (Internet Protocol).
4. **Link Layer**: This layer is responsible for the physical transmission of
   data over a network medium. It includes protocols like Ethernet and Wi-Fi.

## OSI (Open System Interconection) Model

It explain how the communication between a host and its destination works.

1. **Application Layer**: This layer provides network services to applications.
   It includes protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.
2. **Presentation Layer**: This layer is responsible for data translation,
   encryption, and compression. It ensures that data is in a readable format for
   the application layer.
3. **Session Layer**: This layer manages sessions between applications. It
   establishes, maintains, and terminates connections.
4. **Transport Layer**: This layer provides end-to-end communication and
   error recovery. It includes protocols like TCP and UDP.
5. **Network Layer**: This layer is responsible for routing data packets
   across networks. The main protocol at this layer is IP.
6. **Data Link Layer**: This layer handles the physical addressing and
   framing of data. It includes protocols like Ethernet and Ethernet,
   Fibre Chanel, MAC.
7. **Physical Layer**: This layer is responsible for the physical
   transmission of data over a network medium.
